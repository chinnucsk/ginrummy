Bugs
----
- Sometimes when you click the deck to draw a card it fires off the library
  draw call but doesn't return the comet response. When you fire off the second
  click it returns both responses. Could be related to switching to Zak's
  design and parts of the js not matching up.
- Sometimes when you reveal your hand the wrong cards appear. Could be a bug
  related to just having implemented new reveal hand styles.
