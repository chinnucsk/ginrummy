  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>The objective in Gin Rummy is to score more points than your opponent.</p>
  <p>The basic game strategy is to improve one's hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. Two types of meld exist:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank. For example, 8H-8S-8C.</li>
    <li>Runs of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit. For example, 3H-4H-5H-6H.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A player's "deadwood" cards are those not in any meld. His deadwood count is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards - aces are scored at 1 point, face cards at 10, and others according to their numerical values. Intersecting melds are not allowed; therefore, if a player has a 3-card set and a 3-card run sharing a common card, he can only count one of them and must count two cards as deadwood.</p>
